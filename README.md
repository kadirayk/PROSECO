# PROSECO
The PROtotype-based SErvice COmposition (PROSECO) Framework is a free and open-source Java tool 
for automated service composition. PROSECO uses prototypes as basis of the services, and builds 
up on these prototypes by gathering user input. Services could be any type of server application.
Current examples include automated machine learning and cloud gaming.

## Building and Running PROSECO
In order to build PROSECO:
* clone or download the [source code](https://github.com/fmohr/PROSECO): `git clone https://github.com/fmohr/PROSECO.git`
* in the root folder run `gradlew build -x test`
* PROSECO-*.jar should be generated in the root directory run it with: `java -jar PROSECO-*.jar`
* You can then access the web application via `http://localhost:8080`

PROSECO needs prototypes to operate:
* AutoML Prototype can be set up using instructions at: https://git.cs.upb.de/SFB901-Testbed/automl-prototype
* Cloud Gaming Prototype can be set up using instructions at: https://github.com/kadirayk/game

## Setting up your IDE
### Eclipse
In the root folder run: 

```./gradlew eclipse```

This automatically creates the eclipse project files and configures the dependencies among the projects. 
Then open Eclipse and go to the import menu, e.g., in the package manager. 
Choose to import Existing Projects into Workspace, select the root folder, 
and check the **Search for nested projects** option.
