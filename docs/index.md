# PROSECO
The PROtotype-based SErvice COmposition (PROSECO) Framework is a free and open-source Java tool 
for automated service composition. PROSECO uses prototypes as basis of the services, and builds 
up on these prototypes by gathering user input. Services could be any type of server application.
Current examples include automated machine learning and cloud gaming.
